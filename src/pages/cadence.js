            , and was growing an engineering team of seasoned and driven people
            with a capacity for mentorship and dedication to quality that even I
            (inexperienced) could sense was special.

            I was given a lot of autonomy over my work here, where I built the
            company's first internal tool for the AI team to monitor their model
            results. Something I learned to embrace was pushing forward with an
            implementation even when I really did not know what was going on ðŸ’€.
            Working in frameworks like
            <a
              className={classes.link}

            with limited to no frontend examples made configurations that I
            already thought challenging (user auth, linting, querying, global
            contexts, etc.) the easier parts of development.

            I recruited for Cadence because its mission to provide remote
            patient care to those with chronic diseases really resonated with
            me. Unexpectedly, I discovered a depth and excitement to my work
            that I hope to find again.

            This is probably my favorite experience in tech so far. Working at
            Cadence made me realize that I may want to lead my own company one
            day, or at the very least be apart of shaping a successful one.
