            I wish I could summon some tale about how I discovered the joys of
            computing from the bowels of my Bay Area youth, but I just went to
            UC Berkeley. However, I did discover said joys at Cal and I just
            graduated. Go ‡∏Ö’û‚Ä¢Ôªå‚Ä¢’û‡∏Ö üíï

            Searching for full time software engineering positions. I want to
            work on projects with a tangible social impact that also technically
            challenge me every (other) day. Most of my experience has been on
            full stack projects, but I love learning anything new.

            Something I've realized is that a good team goes a long way, but
            good leadership goes even further. Feedback is a two way street.
            Problems exist, and the right people will make you feel better about
            communicating what those problems are.
